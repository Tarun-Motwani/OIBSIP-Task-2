His innings in the semi-finals against Australia helped India to a 15-run victory and a place in the finals. <br><br>
        While he was unable to push India to a satisfying target. MSD’s captainship and cool-headedness in the final over led India to a victory against Pakistan in the final. Dhoni also played an important role in India’s run to the final of the 2014 T20 World Championships. He was declared in the Team of the tournament. <br><br>
        By the 2011 WC, Dhoni was the captain of all three Tests, T20I, and ODI’s. Dhoni’s major contribution with the bat came in the finals against Sri Lanka. Chasing 275 at the Wankhede, Dhoni promoted himself up the order after Sachin, Sehwag, and  Virat Kohli lost their wickets early. <br><br>
        Dhoni and Gambir then build a steady partnership to stabilise the Indian innings. Dhoni had scored 60 from 60 balls, after which started accelerating. He scored the winning six of Numan Kulaeskara, a shot which no one will forget and won the Man of the Match award.Dhoni’s crucial decision to promote himself up the order to put off Muralitharan’s spin threat and right hand-left hand combo showed why he was one of India’s best captains.
